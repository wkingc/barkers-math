If the starter smells like over-ripe fruit, indicating a buildup of lactic acid, you will end up with a more buttery flavour. If the starter goes longer, it will begin to have a vinegary smell, indicating a buildup of acetic acid, and the final loaf will be more sour.
        2) Melt the butter and mix the dry ingedients, minus the salt, with 90-95 degree water in a tub and let them hydrate for about 30 minutes before incorporating the salt, melted butter, and levain using the pencer method (see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HoY7CPw0E1s for a demonstration). The target temperature of the dough at the end of the final mix is 77-78 degrees.
        3) Bulk ferment the dough until it has roughly doubled in size from the build up of gas (approx. 8-9 hours). Build up the dough's gluten structure by briefly kneading the dought at 30 minute intervals during the bulk ferment's first two hours.
        5) After the bulk ferment, preshape the dough into a round with a slight amount of tension, and let it benchrest for 15 minutes. Afterward, flour the top of the dough, flip, and create a sausage-roll loaf with tension by pushing it back as you roll it (see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIzKcred_lc for a demonstation of the shaping technique). Put the loaf seam-side down in a greased 2 lb loaf pan and loosely cover it (a disposable plastic shower cap works well!).
        6) Let the dough rise until it has crested about 1 inch above the rim of the pan (approx. 2 hours).
        7) Preheat your oven to 350 degrees and bake the loaf for 35-40 minutes, tenting it with aluminum foil after 25-30 minutes if the top is browning too quickly.
        8) Remove baked loaf from its tin and place on a cooling rack for a minimum of one hour, but preferably two hours, before slicing.")

Loosely cover the proofing basket (a disposable plastic shower cap works well!) and put in a refrigerator to proof for 12-14 hours.
        6) Preheat your baking vessel (see https://challengerbreadware.com/product/challenger-bread-pan/ for my recommendation) in the oven for an hour at 425 degrees. Place your proofed bread in the baking vessel and score. If there is enough room without touching the bread, add one or two ice cubes for extra steam. Bake for 20 minutes.
        7) After 20 minutes remove the baking vessel cover and bake for another 25 minutes, or until your desired crust color is achieved.

        6) Load a pizza and set a timer for 5 minutes. Switch the oven back to broil and observe until the pizza is finished, about 1-2 minutes.
